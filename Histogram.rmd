# Quick tutorial on Histograms

First we need to make sure we have three packages installed for this example: Lahman, sqldf, and ggplot2

```{r}
library(Lahman)
library(sqldf)
library(ggplot2)
```

# Step One

## Gather Data

Any variable can be looked at. Let's check out weight.

```{r}
query<-"SELECT weight FROM Master"
result<-sqldf(query)

```
# Step Two

## Write The Plot

```{r}
ggplot()+
  geom_histogram(data=result,aes(x=weight),color="blue",fill="pink",bins=60)+
  ggtitle("Player Weight")+
  xlab(" Weight of Player")+
  ylab("Number of Players")
```
